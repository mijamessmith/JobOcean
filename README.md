### Description <a name="description"></a>
A mobile first website allowing job seekers to create a profile, browse job listings, apply for jobs, and create custom reminders for tracking their job search and in-progress applications. Employers can create profiles, add jobs, and then review and accept applications.

This project runs through three individual, dockerized microservices:
1. A mongoDB database and API server
2. A React client sitting on an express server
3. An Express based Authentication server and service

### Goal <a name="goal"></a>
This project was a brief 1-week sprint where our team tried to complete an MVP for a client Greg Horne, who presented us with a condensed product description, feature list, and color scheme.
I was responsible for the back-end

### Role <a name="role"></a>
*Product Manager and Software Engineer*
As Product Manager I was responsible for daily standups, team Trello boards, and client communication and feature/timeline negotiation.
As an engineer I was reponsible for the backend service and its relationship and communication with the front end client, including client side HTTP requests and React State management.
